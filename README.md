# STAUPresets

STAUPresets is a fork of [SillyTavern-WorldInfoPresets](https://github.com/LenAnderson/SillyTavern-WorldInfoPresets/). 

## Added functions

- **Lock to Chat or Character**: Lorebook presets can now be locked to chats and/or characters. 
- **Global Settings Lock**: Global lorebook settings are also now part of saved presets. 

## Removed functions

- **Farewell, Little Truck**: The little truck (wiswitch) has been removed as ST now natively supports moving lorebook entries as of release 1.13.1. (Copying requires one more step, but it is not onerous IMHO.)
